# TodoList

I am building a TodoList application in Flutter from scratch.

Features:
* Adding and Removing Todos [x]
* Editing Todos [x]
* Saving Todos to an SQLite DB [x]
* Apply different colors to every single todo [x]
* Add categories of Todos to sort by []
* Send notifications when a Todo is due []
  * Difficulties: Android and IOS are vastly different in the way they handle Notifications. Furthermore, I don't own any apple devices to code IOS specific components.
* Add Project to Google Firebase and let Users create accounts []
* Allow export of Todos into a calender format eg. Google Calendar []
* Save Users TodoList online so they can access their todos on different devices []
